My name is Lucas Jansen and I am an electronic and software engineer from Cork, Ireland. I have a BE and MEngSc in Electrical and Electronic engineering from University College Cork, and I currently work on embedded software for Qualcomm.

- I know C, Python, (some) C++, a bit of Rust, I'm farmiliar with a couple of flavours of assembly.
- I'm constantly working on some random project. I always lose interest after a while so most never see the light of day.
- I'm happy to collaborate on pretty much anything hardware or low-level software, but I get easily confused by anything web based.
