I am an electronic and software engineer from Cork, Ireland. I have a master's degree Electrical and
Electronic engineering, and I currently work on embedded software at Qualcomm.

- I know C, Python, (some) C++, a bit of Rust, and a couple of flavours of assembly. 
- I'm constantly working on some random project. I eventually end up losing interest in most, but
it's a habit I'm trying *really* hard to break.
- I'm happy to collaborate on pretty much anything hardware or low-level software, but I get easily
scared by anything web related.
